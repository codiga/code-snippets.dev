### What is it?

This repository is for our [snipt.dev](https://www.snipt.dev/) website, a Code Snippets search engine. Code Snippets are code blocks you can share and reuse.
By defining reusable code blocks you can import in your IDE, you not only improve your productivity but you also make sure you always import the correct code and are not missing anything (e.g. missing argument, not checking error code or exceptions).

### Why Code Snippets are important?

When using code snippets for yourself, you make sure you define code once and reuse it correctly in other codebases. It guarantees you are not missing an argument or an error case.When sharing code snippets in a team, it ensures that the team is using the same code consistently. By having a library of code snippets shared with your team, you ensure that your team is always using safe, vetted code patterns in all your code base.

### How to use a snippet in your IDE?

As for sharing, it all depend on the editor. VS Code lets you type an abbreviation to reuse a code snippet and JetBrains live template lets you reuse code blocks in their IDE. Codiga snippets manager lets you search and import code snippets using their Coding Assistant function that is triggered using âŒ˜ + SHIFT + C [Mac] or CTRL + ALT + C [Windows] on VS Code or âŒ˜/CTRL + ALT + C in JetBrains. You can learn more about the Codiga snippet manager in the tool section.

### How we made this?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
